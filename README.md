### Sixth Street

You play an analysis game against the engine.
You play both white and black, Then it's your turn. 
You have 6 plies to play. You can play any line you like.
Then it's engine's turn. It also has 6 plies.
Engine will analyse your lines, and prefer to keep your accurate moves, and surely drop your inaccurate moves, and make a new move for each dropped move.
Each accurate move you get a point. 4, 5 or 6 accurate moves you get bonus points. No accurate moves game ends.
You can use your plies either as separate lines or a single line, whichever you feel is comfortable for you.
Essentially you can be playing at most 6 games at once, against the engine.


## Considerations

Player doesn't choose a color. Essentially player will try to find a drawing line without blundering for both sides. This might come as easy, just exchanging pieces willingly might put you in a situation. 
To make things interesting and combat this, engine might have a temper that doesn't so much prefer your moves but picks other random but accurate moves adding more diversity to the game.

Occasionaly, user might want to show a losing line, by indicating the played move as a blunder and give a continuation. This might be incentivized somehow. Similarly user might want to indicate a line as a forcing line, like if a move is the only best move available.
